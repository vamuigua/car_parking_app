## üî®Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Vue, Vite, TailwindCSS, Pinia, Axios

**Backend:** Laravel, Sanctum

**Database:** MySQL


## üöÄ Getting Started & Run Locally 

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vamuigua/car_parking_app.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd car_parking_app
```

## üìêSetting app the different apps
From here you will see two folders: `backend` and `frontend` .The `backend` is the laravel app that servers the APIs to the`frontend` which is a Vue JS application.

We shall first install and configure the `backend` then afterwards the `frontend`:

### 1. Backend Configuration (Laravel App)
Go to the `backend` directory

```bash
  cd backend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  composer install
```

Change directory permissison

```bash
  chmod -R 777 storage bootstrap/cache
```

Create an `.env` file

```bash
  touch .env
  cp .env.example .env
```

Update the following environment variables in the `.env` file:

```bash
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
SESSION_DOMAIN=localhost
SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS=localhost:5173
```

Generate an Application Key

```bash
  php artisan key:generate
```

Migrate the Database

*PS: Ensure you have created a database of your choose before hand e.g `car_packing_app`*

```bash
  php artisan migrate
```

Start the app by running the server

```bash
  php artisan serve
```

The `backend` app will be served on URL http://localhost:8000/

Now we can move to configuring the `frontend`

### 2. Frontend Configuration (Vue JS App)
Go to the `frontend` directory

```bash
  cd frontend
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Create an `.env` file

```bash
  touch .env
```

Update the following environment variable in the `.env` file:

```
VITE_CAR_PARKING_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:8000
```

*E.g http://localhost:8000 is the URL serving the laravel application.*

Start the app server

```bash
  npm run dev
```

The `frontend` app will be served on URL http://localhost:5173/

‚úÖ **Start using myParking app:** Once the app is running, you can start by creating an account by visiting the [registration page](http://localhost:5173/register) and explore the app's features.
